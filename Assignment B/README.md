# Compilation

Compilation can be done by entering the `src` folder and executing the following command:

    javac *.java

# Execution

The execution can get started by issuing the following command:

    java MainScript

# Entering parameters

The program asks for each parameter explicitly.
The first parameter is the filename.
The second parameter is the number of steps that the program should run.
Then it asks for the eight system parameters, seperated by spaces.
Finally it asks for the starting population of the predators and the prey.

When execution was successful, no further output is given.
The result is written to the file specified in the first step.
